## Team 2 "Team Summer" entry - Summer Sport Guesser 

App Title: Summer Sport Guesser

Our app is designed for someone who is bored and looking to challenge themselves with a good image guessing game on a hot summer day. Summer themed images of course! All sports that one might partake in.



UX

The user interface is relatively straightforward. When you arrive at the site, the game is already to go. But if you look at the navbar, the instructions are right there also.

The wireframe for the design is included in the github repo. Take a look!

Features

The index.html file presents the user with a blurred image, of which is sequentially "un-blurred" every time they guess wrong. Making it easier to guess what the image is. This of course means they get less points every wrong answer they submit. 

There is a nav bar at the top, presenting how to play the game, and an about page.

Technologies Used

We used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Javascript, and Font Awesome.
